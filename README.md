# JAVASCRIPT BASIC TOPICS

> First of all, let this book ([JavaScript Succinctly](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7lZTWiV2U7PZ1U2WXJTaktuV2M)) your reference for how the object works and some weird topics about JavaScript.

Listed below some general basic topics about JavaScript. All JavaScript developers must know.

My goal is to keep this document as minimal as I can and keep it reach with keywords, links and a very small snippet of code.

Note: These are some topics in my head, I just need to list them. they're not well organized, but I'll keep maintain and modify this file.

If you have any concern, or you found something wrong, I really appreciate any comment or add.
